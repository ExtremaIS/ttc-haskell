## Overview

TTC, an initialism of _Textual Type Classes_, is a library that provides
`Render` and `Parse` type classes for conversion between data types and
textual data types (strings).  Use the `Show` and `Read` type classes for
debugging/development, and use the `Render` and `Parse` type classes for your
own purposes.  The library also provides a `Textual` type class for conversion
between textual data types as well as functions for validating constants at
compile-time.

Since a type may have at most one instance of a given type class, special care
must be taken when defining type class instances in a shared library.  In
particular, orphan instances should generally *not* be used in shared
libraries since they prevent users of the libraries from writing their own
instances.

`Render` and `Parse` are best used with types that have canonical textual
representations, such as textual identifiers.  When there is more than one way
to create a textual representation, such as configurable formatting, using a
normal function is probably more appropriate.  Such a function can make use of
the `Textual` type class to support multiple textual data types.

This overview includes a brief introduction of the library.  The following
resources are also available:

### `Textual`

The `Textual` type class is used to convert between the following textual data
types:

* `String`
* Strict `Text`
* Lazy `Text`
* `Text` `Builder`
* Strict `ByteString`
* Lazy `ByteString`
* `ByteString` `Builder`
* `ShortByteString`

This type class has two key features:

* Type conversion is *not* done through a fixed type (such as `String` or
  `Text`).
* It has a single type variable, making it easy to write functions that
  accept arguments and/or return values that may be any of the supported
  textual data types.

For more details, see the [Textual Type Class][] article.

### `Render`

The `Render` type class renders a data type as a `Textual` data type:

```haskell
class Render a where
  render :: Textual t => a -> t
```

It is analogous to the `Show` type class, which can be reserved for
debugging/development.

The `render` function returns any of the supported textual data types.  Use
the textual data type that is most natural in the implementation of `render`
instances, and return values are converted to other textual data types when
necessary.  The `Show` and `IsString` type classes are not used, so use of the
`String` type is not required.

As a simple example, consider a `Username` type that is implemented as a
`newtype` over `Text`:

```haskell
module Username (Username) where

import Control.Monad (unless, when)
import Data.Char (isAsciiLower)
import qualified Data.Text as T
import Data.Text (Text)
import qualified Data.TTC as TTC

newtype Username = Username Text
  deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)

instance TTC.Render Username where
  render (Username t) = TTC.convert t
```

If a username needs to be included in a `String` error message, conversion is
automatic:

```haskell
putStrLn $ "user not found: " ++ TTC.render uname
```

For more details, see the [Render and Parse][] article.

### `Parse`

The `Parse` type class parses a data type from a `Textual` data type:

```haskell
class Parse a where
  parse :: (Textual t, Textual e) => t -> Either e a
```

It is analogous to the `Read` type class, which can be reserved for
debugging/development.

The `parse` function takes any of the supported textual data types as an
argument.  Use the textual data type that is most natural in the
implementation of `parse` instances, and arguments are converted from other
textual data types when necessary.  The `IsString` type class is not used, so
use of the `String` type is not required.

Here is an example instance for `Username`, implementing some restrictions:

```haskell
instance TTC.Parse Username where
  parse = TTC.asT $ \t -> first TTC.fromS $ do
    unless (T.all isAsciiLower t) $ Left "username has invalid character(s)"
    let len = T.length t
    when (len < 3) $ Left "username has fewer than 3 characters"
    when (len > 12) $ Left "username has more than 12 characters"
    pure $ Username t
```

If a username needs to be parsed from a `String`, conversion is automatic:

```haskell
case TTC.parse "tcard" :: Either String Username of
  Right uname -> putStrLn $ "valid username: " ++ TTC.render uname
  Left err -> putStrLn $ "invalid username: " ++ err
```

For more details, see the [Render and Parse][] article.

### Constant Validation

TTC provides functions to validate constants at compile-time, using Template
Haskell.  For example, a `Username` constant can be defined as follows:

```haskell
user :: Username
user = $$(TTC.valid "tcard")
```

For more details, see the [Validated Constants][] article.

## Related Work

### Rendering and Parsing

The [relude](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/relude) library has
polymorphic versions of `show` and `readEither` in `Relude.String.Conversion`,
as well as various type classes for converting between string types.  This
does not encourage using `Show` and `Read` instances with syntactically valid
Haskell syntax, and it encourages the using of the `String` data type.

The [rio](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio) library has a `Display`
type class with a similar goal as `TTC.Render`.  Since the library encourages
a uniform usage of textual data types, `Display` only provides functions for
rendering to `Text` and a builder format.  It does not have a type class
similar to `TTC.Parse`.

Harry Garrood has an interesting series of blog posts about type classes and
`Show`:

* [Down with Show! Part 1: Rules of thumb for when to use a type class](https://harry.garrood.me/blog/down-with-show-part-1/)
* [Down with Show! Part 2: What's wrong with the Show type class](https://harry.garrood.me/blog/down-with-show-part-2/)
* [Down with Show! Part 3: A replacement for Show](https://harry.garrood.me/blog/down-with-show-part-3/)

### Validating Constants

The
[validated-literals](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/validated-literals)
library has a `Validate` type class that is similar to `TTC.Parse` but
supports conversion between arbitrary types, not just from textual data types.
Template Haskell functions are provided to perform validation at compile-time.
Result types must either have `Lift` instances or equivalent implementations.

Chris Done posted
[a gist](https://gist.github.com/chrisdone/809296b769ee36d352ae4f8dbe89a364)
about implementing statically checked overloaded strings.

### String Type Conversion

There are a number of libraries that simplify conversion between string types.

The following libraries provide type classes with two type variables.  The
primary benefit of this approach is that one can add support for any string
type.  The drawback of this approach is that implementations of `Render` and
`Parse` using such a type class would have to be done via a fixed type,
resulting in unnecessary conversion when using other types.

* [string-conv](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/string-conv)
* [string-conversions](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/string-conversions)

The following library provide type classes with a single type variable, but
conversion is done via a fixed type.

* [hxt-regex-xmlschema](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hxt-regex-xmlschema)
  has a `StringLike` type class and does conversion via the `String` type
* [ListLike](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ListLike) has a `StringLike`
  type class and does conversion via the `String` type
* [monoid-subclasses](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/monoid-subclasses)
  provides a `TextualMonoid` type class that provides an abstract API over
  textual types, using `String` as the underlying type
* [stringlike](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/stringlike) converts via
  the `Text` type
* [tagsoup](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tagsoup) has a `StringLike`
  type class that provides an abstract API over textual types and a
  `castString` function that converts via the `String` type
* [text-conversions](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-conversions)
  converts via the `Text` type
* [textual](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/textual) (deprecated)
  converts via the `String` type

### Arbitrary Type Conversion

There are also a number of libraries that provide type classes for conversion
between arbitrary types, including string types.

* [basement](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/basement) provides type
  classes for conversion that may fail as well as conversion that cannot fail
* [convertible](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/convertible)
* [witch](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/witch) provides type classes for
  conversion that may fail as well as conversion that cannot fail
