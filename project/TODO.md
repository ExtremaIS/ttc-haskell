# `ttc-haskell` TODO

## Functionality

## Tests

## Compatibility

* TTC now builds using GHC 9.12.1 without issue using Cabal.  Stack 3.1.1 has
  issues, but they should be resolved in Stack 3.3.1 (already released).  When
  Stack 3.3.1 is added to GHCup, I will confirm, push, and make a Hackage
  revision.

### Future

* [`linear-builder`](https://github.com/Bodigrim/linear-builder)
  support requires GHC 9.2 or later.

* Support for GHC 8.8 and Cabal 3.0 may be removed after 2025-07-15.
